# Population
#-----> Collection of all items of interest 
# Notation: N
# Example: All students in a school

# Sample 
#-----> Subset of the population
# Notation: n
# Example: 50 students selected from the school


#  Types  of data 

# There are two types of data
# Categorical Data
# Numerical Data

# Categorical Data
#-----> Data that can be divided into groups or categories
# 1. Car brands : Audi, BMW, Toyota
# 2. Colors : Red, Blue, Green
# 3. Answers to yes/no questions


# Numerical Data
#-----> Numerical data represents numbers.
# it is divided into two types 
# 1. Discrete Data
#-------> Discrete data can be usually counted in a finite matter
# Example: Number of students in a class, Number of cars in a parking lot

# 2. Continuous Data
#-------> Continuous data is infinte and impossible to count 

# Example: Height of students, Weight of students, Temperature
# Discrete : children  you want to have, SAT Score
# Continous : height, weight



# Levels of Measurement
# There are four levels of measurement
# 1. Qualitative
# Nominal------> This cannot be put in order
# Example : car brands, colors, four seasons(spring, summer, fall, winter)
# Ordinal ------> This can be put in order
# Example : movie ratings (poor, fair, good, excellent), education level (high school, bachelor's, master's)

# 2. Quantitative 
# Interval-------> This can be put in order and the difference between two values is meaningful
# Example : Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, IQ scores
# Ratio-------> This can be put in order, the difference is meaningful, and there is a true zero point
# Example : Height, weight, duration

# What do you mean by true zero point?
# A true zero point means that the value of zero indicates the absence of the quantity being measured.
# For example, in the case of height, a height of zero means there is no height at all.
# In contrast, in the case of temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit, a temperature of zero does not mean there is no temperature; it is simply a point on the scale.
# Therefore, height and weight are measured on a ratio scale because they have a true zero point, while temperature is measured on an interval scale because it does not have a true zero point.
